        <h1>What is Game Up?</h1>
        <p>
          Game Up! is a website created to help our community find local
          gaming-related events to participate in. We are currently enrolled at
          Florida International University (FIU) and thoroughly enjoy playing
          games in our spare time. At FIU, game events are hosted on campus and
          people from all over come to watch. We decided to spread that shared
          love of gaming by creating Game Up!
