# ShellHacks-2022
Welcome to our Game Up! our website for the ShellHacks-2022 Competition!
Game Up! is a webstite created to help our community find local gaming-related events to participate in.
We are currently enrolled at Florida International University (FIU) and thoroughly enjoy playing games in our spare time. 
At FIU, game events are hosted on campus and people from all over come to watch. We decided to spread that shared love of gaming by creating Game Up!

Four people worked very hard to complete this project. Their contact info is as follows.
